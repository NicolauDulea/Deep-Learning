##Dermatology Problem
In this topic, you will develop a deep-learning model to address a dermatology classification 
problem. The dataset used in this project contains several images, each corresponding to only 
one specific disease. The folder contains only the metadata of each image with some disease 
information such as malignant/benign, angle scores, and the URL of the images of skin 
lesions. The column "label" from the CSV file is your target column. The annotated images 
represent 114 skin conditions, with at least 53 images and a maximum of 653 images per skin 
condition.
The dataset of images was taken from the “FITZPATRICK17” repository. The Fitzpatrick 
scale is a numerical classification schema for human skin color. It was developed in 1975 by 
American dermatologist Thomas B. Fitzpatrick to estimate the response of different types of 
skin to ultraviolet light. The dataset is a combination of two dermatology datasets, 
“DermaAmin” and “ATLAS Dermatologico”. Your task is to build a model that performs well 
on unseen images. For that, you have to split the dataset into three splits: train, validation, and 
test
